# Sheep
*A color changing bot for Discord*

**Sheep** was created as an alternative to Hex, as Hex was recently deleted. The bot can be used like Hex to create custom color roles for users in your server.

## Getting Started
Use [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=585271178180952064&permissions=268495936&scope=bot) to invite Sheep to your server. After this, make sure they can see messages, manage roles, embed links, and read whatever channel you plan to use them in.

You can use `s!help` to get a rundown of the commands, or visit their website [here](https://sheep.greysdawn.com)

If you've previously used Hex and still have the roles it creates, you can use `s!cu` to remove the USER- prefix on all of them, making them work with Sheep

## Features
- Short, easy syntax (`s!c color`)
- Command to automatically convert Hex's color roles into ones Sheep can use
- Automatically moves color roles below the Sheep role to allow default colors
- Open source!
- Relatively small codebase
- Uses tinycolor2 for colors, meaning they accept RGB, HSL, hex, and color names (list found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)) as valid colors
- Previews colors using a Minecraft sheep!
- Automatically deletes color roles when users leave the server
